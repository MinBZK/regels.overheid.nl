## Pull request

You can also contribute by submitting a pull request. If you wish to do so find an issue in the issues list. For a more detailed description of contributing in this way see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/MinBZK/regels.overheid.nl/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Review process

After having submitted a pull request the code will have to be reviewed by either [@sgort](https://github.com/sgort) or [@onursagir](https://github.com/onursagir). If the any UI changes have been made a temporary environment of the Storybook stories will be deployed and an other additional review by [@Henneddd](https://github.com/Henneddd) will be required. This will ensure the pull request conforms to the design and technical requirements.
